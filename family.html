        I come from a family of five members: my father, my mother, my middle brother, my little sister, 
        and me. Each of us plays a unique role in making our family a loving and supportive unit. Our 
        close bond is something that I cherish deeply.

            <h2><u>My Bapak & Ibu</u></h2>
            <p>
                First, let me talk about my father. His name is <b>Jailani Bin Tumiran</b>, born and raised in <b>Muar, Johor</b>, 
                and he is the pillar of our family. He works as a supervisor at Bulk Mail Center, Shah Alam, 
                providing for us and ensuring that we have everything we need. One thing I admire most about 
                my father is his willingness to fight for what he wants. He always teaches us important values, 
                such as hard work and kindness. He also never failed to provide us with enough education and 
                necessities. In his free time, he enjoys gardening and loves to watch Korean variety shows such 
                as Three Meals a Day and more!</p>
            <p>
                Next, there’s my mother, <b>Shouti Noor Fahmi Binti Hashim</b>, that was born at Kuala Lumpur, but growing up at <b>Lubok China, Melaka</b>. She is the heart of our family, and 
                her warmth and care keep us all connected. My mother works as a clerk at one of Pos Malaysia 
                Branch, and despite her busy schedule, she always finds time for us. Her cooking is something I 
                look forward to every day, especially when she makes Eid tradition foods. I also admire her 
                dedication to becoming the righthand of the family, and she’s always there to lend a listening ear 
                when any of us need advice or comfort.

            <h2><u>My Brother</u></h2>
            <p>
                Then there’s my little brother, <b>Aiman Najwan</b>. He is 17 years old and is in high school. We have 
                our differences sometimes, but he is always there for me when I need help. He really loves cars
                and has a bunch of Hot Wheel’s collection in his bedroom. Even though I rarely be at home, we 
                always make time to go out along with our little sister for food hunting, bookstore shopping and 
                watching movies.

            <h2><u>My Little Sister</u></h2>
            <p>
                My little sister <b>Quratun Nabihah</b> is the baby of the family. She’s 15 years old and we might say 
                that she is a copycat of me. She loves books and always sends me her new book-to-buy list every 
                time she gets one. Even though she’s younger, she’s incredibly sharp and quick to learn. I enjoy 
                spending time with her, whether it’s helping her with her schoolwork or playing her favorite game 
                and gossiping over our recent readings. Watching her grow up is truly a special experience.

            <p>
                Lastly, not to forget my two-favorite person, our grandparents, <b>Mr. Hashim</b> and <b>Mrs. Fatimah</b>. 
                They have always been a source of comfort and wisdom for our family. I love spending time with 
                them because they have the most amazing stories about the past, and I learn so much from their 
                experiences. I remember myself going back home after went to kindergarten and shows what I 
                did over the day. My grandparents always spoil us with delicious homemade treats, especially fish 
                curry which is my absolute favorite! I admire their strength, kindness, and the way they have held 
                our family together over the years. They are truly the heart of our extended family, and I feel so 
                grateful to have them in my life.
